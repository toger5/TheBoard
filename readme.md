# TheBoard
This project is whiteboard (similar to oneNote) which is
using Matrix as its backend. All your drawings are stored in matrix rooms
on your matrix server and are accessible to anyone who is invited.

## DISCLAIMER!
The spec for the whiteboard events are still subject to change. It is **NOT** recommanded to use it for anything else than testing during the Alpha!
It is recommanded to always create seperate rooms just for testing this app. So they can be left and replaced by new ones when the protocol changes!

## How this project came to life
I was dreaming of a good open source solution for one note since a long time.
There are great projects [Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/) and [whitebophir](https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir).
But while Xournal++ entirely lacks collaborative whiteboard needs self hosting to have a reliable solution and has no method of structuring all my notes/whiteboards. (Not to mention, that even one notes collaboration features are really poor as well...)

I was thinking about the exact requirments I wanted for such a whiteboard:
 - Real time synchronization (cloud storage)
 - Authentication/account infrastucture (to invite and collaborate on one whiteboard)
 - Adding/Removing ppl to a whiteboard
 - Relibale hosting (when having cloud storage I dont want to trust a one man project to continue hosting. And a lot of ppl wont self host.)
 - Structuring whiteboards in categories
 - Viewing history and display which part has been drawn by which person
 - Annotating other whiteboards with new layers
 - Hosting for media like pdf's and images

Looking at this list, Matrix was such an obvious choice. I could comment every point but basically with: "A whiteboard should be a Matrix room" everything is said.

**TheBoard (probably not the final name) is exactly that.** The frontend is not done yet but already in an okay looking and usable state.
**Before trying it out:** It takes really long to login with an account with lots of rooms. So I highly recommand to NOT use your main Matrix account.
Additionally it is necassary to tag rooms as whiteboards. (really unintuitve ux that will be improoved) But for now the + button needs to be pressed and a (empty (not necassary but recommanded) AND UNENCRYPTED) room needs to be selected.
The app is available at [toger5.github.io/TheBoard](https://toger5.github.io/TheBoard). \
_As always: use at your own Risk_
